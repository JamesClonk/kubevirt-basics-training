In this section we will see how we can define Instance Types and Preferences. These provide a way to define a set of
runtime characteristics like resources or performance settings which can be reused.

## Lab Goals

* Know the benefit of `VirtualMachineInstancetype` and `VirtualMachinePreference`
* Define your own instance type and preference settings.
* Use defined types and preferences for virtual machines.
