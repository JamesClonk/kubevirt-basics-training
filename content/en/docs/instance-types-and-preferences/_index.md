  Learn how to use and define instance types and preferences
---

In this section we will see how we can define instance types and preferences. These provide a way to define a set of
runtime characteristics like resources or performance settings which can then be reused.


## Lab goals

* Know the benefit of `VirtualMachineInstancetype` and `VirtualMachinePreference`
* Examine common instance types and preferences
* Deploy VMs with a common instance type
* Define your own instance type and preference settings
* Use your custom instance types with your VMs
