In this section we will see how we can define Instance Types and Preferences. These provide a way to define a set of
runtime characteristics like resources or performance settings which can then be reused.


## Lab Goals

* Know the benefit of `VirtualMachineInstancetype` and `VirtualMachinePreference`
* Examine Common Instance types and Preferences.
* Deploy VMs with a common Instance type.
* Define your own Instance type and Preference settings.
* Use your custom Instance types with your VMs.
