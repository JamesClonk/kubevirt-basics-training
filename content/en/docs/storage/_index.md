---

In this section we focus on attaching storage volumes provided by Kubernetes storage drivers to our virtual machines.
We also have a look at hotplugging and resizing disks.


## Lab goals

* Mount storage as disks or filesystems
* Use filesystem and block devices
* Mount ConfigMaps and Secrets
* Hotplug storage
* Resize disks
